Supply Chain Forecasting and Optimization using AI
This project demonstrates how to develop and test an AI-powered system for supply chain demand forecasting, supply chain disruption simulation, and inventory optimization. 
The system uses a combination of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for demand forecasting, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) for simulating supply 
chain disruptions, and Q-Learning for optimizing inventory management decisions.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive solution for optimizing supply chain operations using AI and machine learning techniques. The project includes the following components:

Demand Forecasting: Using LSTM to forecast future demand based on historical sales data.
Supply Chain Disruption Simulation: Using GANs to simulate potential supply chain disruptions (e.g., supplier delays).
Inventory Optimization: Using Q-Learning to optimize inventory management and make decisions about reordering stock based on predicted demand and current stock levels

Features:
LSTM-based Demand Forecasting: Forecasts future sales demand using historical data.
GAN-based Supply Chain Disruption Simulation: Simulates disruption scenarios to model real-world supply chain challenges.
Q-Learning-based Inventory Optimization: Makes decisions on whether to reorder stock based on predicted future demand.
Visualizations: Provides insights into the systemâ€™s performance with plots comparing predicted vs. actual data, simulated disruptions, and inventory decisions.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the LSTM and GAN models.
NumPy/Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the results.
Q-Learning Algorithm: Used for inventory optimization.
